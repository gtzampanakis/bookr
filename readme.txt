About Bookr
===========
Bookr is a document reader for the Sony PSP licensed under the GNU General
Public License v2. At the moment it supports plain text and PDF files.


Install
=======
You need a Sony PSP with firmware version 1.5. Other firmware versions are not
supported. To install simply copy the __SCE__bookr and %__SCE__bookr folders
to your Memory Stick \PSP\GAME folder.


Optional CJK PDF Support
========================
In order to support Chinese, Japanese and Korean PDF documents an external font
pack must be downloaded and installed. Around 65MB of additional space is
required in your Memory Stick.

1) Download the file named cjk-fonts-1.zip from the following URL:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149290&package_id=200753

2) Create the following folder in your Memory Stick, where X: is the drive unit
where your PSP is mounted:
X:\PSP\GAME\__SCE__bookr\fonts

3) Extract the contents of the cjk-fonts-1.zip file into the folder. The final
file structure must look like this:
X:\PSP\GAME\__SCE__bookr\fonts\Adobe-CNS1-UCS2
X:\PSP\GAME\__SCE__bookr\fonts\Adobe-GB1-UCS2
X:\PSP\GAME\__SCE__bookr\fonts\Adobe-Japan1-UCS2
